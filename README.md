# Resume

# Summary
This is a resume website I created for myself using Claude.ai for my Innovative Technologies for Design course

# About
Using artificial intelligence to aid the the programming process, I used a variety of digital sketches as a baseline to create this personal resume website.  The goal of this project was to explore front-end programming using artificial intelligence tools and to create a resume that reflected my skills and experiences.

# Tools
- Claude.ai
- Sublime Text

# Demo

# Reflection
Although I have a strong background in front-end development, I struggled to transition from writing code from scratch to using AI.  It is a very different experience than what I am used to, but I am learning.  One of the more frustrating discoveries throughout this process has been versioning. Unfortunately, making edits directly on Claude requires the entire document to be reformatted.  Each time that occurs, the code signature changes, making it very difficult to track version-to-version progress or make in-text edits quickly.
